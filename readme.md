What it is all about
----
This is the accompanying code to a Unity 3D tutorial (I am using Unity 5.3.1) on how to create a tower defense game, as you can see on youtube.

The game features 3 different tower types, basic bullet, slow effect and mortar/meteor, with projectile trajectory, explosion and area of effect, as well as some shoot ahead logic.

I thought this may be helpful to others, so I upoaded it and made it public here.
